# [Coding-Quiz]("https://kristine-1977.github.io/coding-quiz/")

The assignment to create a coding quiz that will allow the user to keep track of high scores during taking the quiz.
I used bootstrap to get the coding stared and javascript to make it interactive. At this point, development on this quiz has stopped.
